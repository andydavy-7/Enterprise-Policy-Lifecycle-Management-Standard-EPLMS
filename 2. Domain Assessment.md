#### Critical Pain Points Identified:

**1. Policy Complexity and Volume Overload**
- Organizations accumulate vast arrays of policies covering diverse areas
- Keeping track of all policies, ensuring they're up-to-date, and communicating changes becomes overwhelming
- **Impact:** Policies become "shelf-ware" that nobody reads or follows

**2. Version Control Chaos**
- Multiple versions circulating via email and shared drives
- Unclear which version is "current"
- Old policies not removed from circulation
- **Impact:** Employees follow outdated procedures; compliance failures; audit findings

**3. Manual Process Inefficiency**
- Policy creation, review, approval handled via email and meetings
- No automated notifications for assigned stakeholders
- Manual coordination of hand-offs and multiple files
- **Impact:** Policies take months to approve; bottlenecks unidentified; work falls through cracks

**4. Acknowledgment/Attestation Failures**
- No systematic way to track who has read policies
- Paper signature sheets lost, incomplete, or outdated
- Email confirmations buried in inboxes
- **Impact:** Cannot prove employee awareness; liability exposure; audit failures

**5. Compliance Mapping Nightmares**
- Mapping policies to regulatory/accreditation standards done manually
- Difficult to demonstrate coverage for audit
- Changes in regulations require extensive rework
- **Impact:** Audit preparation takes months; gaps discovered late; penalties

**6. Lack of Periodic Review**
- Policies created but never reviewed or updated
- No triggers for review (time-based or event-based)
- Owners forget accountability
- **Impact:** Policies become outdated, inaccurate, or irrelevant; compliance drift

**7. Search and Discoverability Issues**
- Employees can't find policies when needed
- Policies scattered across intranets, drives, wikis
- No tagging, categorization, or effective search
- **Impact:** Compliance by accident, not design; repeated questions to HR/Legal

### 3.2 Tool Limitations

**Common System Failures:**

- **SharePoint without customization:** Lacks workflow automation, attestation tracking, compliance mapping
- **LMS platforms alone:** Handle training/acknowledgment but not authoring, approval, lifecycle management
- **Email-based processes:** No audit trail, version control, or systematic tracking
- **Spreadsheet tracking:** Error-prone, not real-time, difficult to scale
- **Disconnected tools:** Data silos, manual data entry, no integrated reporting

### 3.3 Process Breakdowns

**Where Processes Fail:**

1. **No ownership clarity:** Multiple people think someone else is responsible
2. **No enforcement:** Policies published but acknowledgment not mandatory
3. **No consequences:** Employees can ignore policies without repercussions
4. **No integration:** Policy management disconnected from HR, IT, operations
5. **No change management:** New systems deployed without training or communication
