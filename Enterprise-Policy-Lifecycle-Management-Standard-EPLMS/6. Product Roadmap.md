## **Key Risks & Mitigation**

| Risk | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|--------|------------|
| **LLM API costs too high** | High | Use open-source models (Llama), cache responses, rate limiting |
| **Enterprise sales cycle too long** | High | Start with mid-market (200-1000 employees), land-and-expand |
| **Competitors (GRC platforms) add adherence features** | Medium | Speed to market (18-month roadmap), AI differentiation |
| **Integration complexity (HRIS, Slack, Teams)** | Medium | Partner with iPaaS (Zapier, Workato) for non-core integrations |
| **Compliance/security incident** | Critical | SOC 2 Type 1 by Phase 1, Type 2 by Phase 3, penetration testing |
| **Adoption resistance (employees don't engage)** | High | Gamification, social proof, multi-channel push, micro-learning |

---

## **Success Metrics (North Star)**

| Metric | Target (Month 17) |
|--------|-------------------|
