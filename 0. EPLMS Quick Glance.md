# **EPLMS Solution Scope - How We Got Here**

**Document Version:** 1.0  
**Date:** December 2025  
**Purpose:** One-page summary of solution scope derivation

---

## **Starting Point: The Global Standard Process**

From ISO 9001, ISO 27001, SOC 2, and 21 CFR Part 11, we identified an **8-stage policy lifecycle**:

1. **Initiation** → 2. **Authoring** → 3. **Approval** → 4. **Distribution** → 5. **Acknowledgment** → 6. **Compliance Monitoring** → 7. **Review/Revision** → 8. **Archival**

---

## **Reality Check: What Organizations Actually Do**

**Current State Analysis revealed:**
- 70-80% of organizations at **low maturity** (manual, email-based)
- **Stages 2-3** (Authoring/Approval): 71% cite version control chaos, 68% cite manual inefficiency
- **Stages 5-7** (Adherence): 78% cite acknowledgment as #1 pain point, compliance monitoring rare
- Tools are **fragmented**: GRC platforms do authoring but weak on adherence; LMS does training but no authoring

**The Gap:** Organizations follow the right stages conceptually, but lack **tools, rigor, and evidence** that standards require.

---

## **Strategic Scope Decision: Stages 2-7**

### **What We're Building:**
A complete **policy lifecycle platform** owning:
- **Creation & Approval** (Stages 2-3): Collaborative authoring, workflow orchestration
- **Distribution & Adherence** (Stages 4-7): Multi-channel delivery, comprehension-verified acknowledgment, AI-powered retrieval, continuous compliance

### **What We're NOT Building:**
- ❌ **Stage 1** (Policy initiation/need identification) - strategic planning activity
- ❌ **Stage 8** (Long-term archival/records management) - specialized compliance domain
- ❌ Full GRC suite, consulting services, or legacy migration

---

## **Why This Scope?**

### **✅ Addresses Top Pain Points:**
- **78%** struggle with acknowledgment → We solve with gamified, comprehension-verified attestation
- **71%** struggle with version control → We solve with Git-style versioning, real-time collaboration
- **68%** struggle with manual processes → We solve with automated workflows, AI assistance

### **✅ Market Differentiation:**
- **Competitors do authoring OR adherence, not both** → We integrate end-to-end (Stages 2-7)
- **Enterprise GRC** platforms: Strong on authoring, weak on employee engagement
- **LMS platforms**: Strong on training/acknowledgment, no authoring or lifecycle management
- **We bridge the gap:** Unified audit trail from first draft → continuous compliance

### **✅ Guaranteeable Outcomes:**
- **50-70% faster policy creation** (8-12 weeks → 2-4 weeks)
- **95% acknowledgment** within 30 days (vs. 30-50% manual)
- **90% comprehension** verification (vs. passive checkbox)
- **60-85% faster audit prep** (1-2 weeks vs. 4-12 weeks)

## **Validation Against Standards**

| Standard | Requirement | Our Scope Addresses |
|----------|-------------|---------------------|
| **ISO 9001** | Version control, approval, availability | ✅ Stages 2-7 |
| **ISO 27001** | Acknowledgment evidence, periodic review | ✅ Stages 5-7 |
| **21 CFR Part 11** | Audit trails, digital signatures | ✅ Stages 2-7 |
| **SOC 2** | Communication, attestation, evidence | ✅ Stages 4-7 |

---

## **The Bottom Line**

**We're not building a document management system.**  
**We're not building an LMS.**  
**We're building the missing link:** A complete **policy lifecycle platform** that ensures policies are **created systematically, approved formally, distributed intelligently, adopted actively, and improved continuously.**

**From Draft → Approval → Distribution → Acknowledgment → Compliance → Continuous Improvement.**

That's Stages 2-7. That's our scope. That's the solution.

## **Strategic Positioning**

**One-Line Pitch:**  
*"We provide an end-to-end platform for policy lifecycle management - from collaborative authoring and structured approval workflows, through contextual distribution and comprehension-verified acknowledgment, to AI-powered retrieval and continuous compliance monitoring."*

**Market Position:**  
- **Not competing with**: Full GRC suites (SAP, Oracle, MetricStream)
- **Not competing with**: Document management (SharePoint, Confluence)
- **Not competing with**: LMS platforms (Cornerstone, Docebo)

**We're the integration layer** that connects policy creation (upstream) with policy adherence (downstream) - the missing piece in the market.
